## 🔧 Features
- User authentication (ID + password)
- Balance inquiry
- Balance deposit (with input validation)
- Balance withdrawal (with input validation and insufficient balance check)
- Clean user interface with simple navigation

## 📁 Project Structure
- Uses `struct` to define user data
- Handles multiple users
- Uses loops, conditionals, and functions for logic handling

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Structures (`struct`)
- Arrays
- Functions
- Input/Output (`cin`, `cout`)
- Loops (`do-while`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Input validation

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Copy the code into any C++ IDE (like Code::Blocks, Dev C++, or VS Code with C++ extension).
2. Compile and run the project.
